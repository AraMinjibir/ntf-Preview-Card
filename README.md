# ntf-Preview-Card
This project was aimed to showcase my basic skills in HTML and CSS.
The goal of this project is to design a 3 distinct  preview card
1. Desktop View with width of 1440px.
2. Active, this will be reflecting accent (one of the css element) when clicking. Indicating its active.
3. Mobile view, this is for those that have mobile, they can get access to this card.
